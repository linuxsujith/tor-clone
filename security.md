Supported Versions
We only ever support the latest version with security updates,
due to the way the Apple App Store works.
Reporting a Vulnerability
Onion Browser was conceived by Mike Tigas but is now almost exclusively
maintained by Guardian Project.
You may reach us on multiple channels:

We suggest GPG encrypted mail or encrypted Matrix chats for
security-related inquiries.
Expect replies on mail within a workday, and near-time answers via chat.
We're happy for any help to get this thing more secure,
and we'll work hard to fix it, but please be aware, that
on iOS, there's a lot outside of our control.
Onion Browser is basically browser chrome around the Webkit
rendering engine and some code to make sure, all traffic is going
through Orbot's Tor Network Extension.
If it turns out, you really found a security problem, you'll
of course get full credits.
Regarding disclosure, we'd be very happy, if you would follow
responsible disclosure guidelines.
Thank you!
